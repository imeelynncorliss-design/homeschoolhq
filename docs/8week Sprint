---

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Calendar sync breaks again during integration
**Mitigation**: 
- Complete Week 1 thoroughly before proceeding
- Don't modify calendar sync code after Week 1
- All integration happens in NEW code, not calendar sync files

### Risk 2: Beta testers hard to find
**Mitigation**:
- Start recruiting now (post in homeschool Facebook groups)
- Offer 3 months free Pro tier as incentive
- Only need 8-10, not 100

### Risk 3: Scope creep
**Mitigation**:
- This sprint plan is the scope. Period.
- Log all "nice to have" ideas for Phase 2
- Stay ruthlessly focused on calendar integration

## Success Criteria for Launch

**Must Have**:
1. ✅ Google Calendar connects and syncs automatically
2. ✅ Conflict warnings appear for overlapping lessons
3. ✅ Dashboard calendar shows all event types
4. ✅ Auto-scheduler avoids work meetings

## Weekly Check-In Questions

Every Sunday, review:
1. Did I complete this week's deliverables?
2. Am I blocked on anything?
3. Do I need to adjust timeline?
4. What did I learn this week?

**If answer to #1 is "no" for 2 weeks in a row, reassess timeline.**

## The Promise to Yourself

"I will not integrate systems until calendar sync is stable. I will not launch with known critical bugs. I will document as I go. I will ask for help when stuck for >2 hours."
